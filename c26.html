                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Hydrating Cleanser:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Begin your skincare routine with a hydrating cleanser that effectively removes impurities while replenishing moisture and supporting the skin's natural barrier function. Look for a creamy cleanser enriched with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides to cleanse the skin without stripping it of essential oils. Massage the cleanser onto damp skin using gentle circular motions, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. Cleanse your face twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin clean and refreshed without compromising its hydration levels.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Antioxidant Serum:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">After cleansing, apply an antioxidant-rich serum to help protect the skin from environmental damage and neutralize free radicals that contribute to premature aging. Choose a lightweight serum formulated with potent antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, or resveratrol to brighten the complexion, improve skin tone, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Apply a few drops of serum to clean, dry skin and gently pat it onto your face and neck until fully absorbed. Use the serum every morning to boost the skin's natural defense mechanisms and enhance overall radiance.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Moisturizing Cream</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Nourish and hydrate your skin with a rich, emollient moisturizing cream that addresses the visible signs of aging while providing long-lasting hydration and support. Look for a luxurious cream infused with moisturizing ingredients like shea butter, peptides, or retinol to smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve elasticity, and promote a more youthful complexion. Apply a generous amount of cream to your face and neck, gently massaging it into the skin using upward motions. Use the moisturizer twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin soft, supple, and visibly rejuvenated.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Eye Cream:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Treat the delicate skin around your eyes with a nourishing eye cream specially formulated to target common aging concerns such as dark circles, puffiness, and crow's feet. Choose an eye cream enriched with peptides, hyaluronic acid, or caffeine to hydrate, firm, and brighten the eye area while reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Gently dab a small amount of eye cream onto the under-eye area and along the orbital bone using your ring finger, then lightly pat it into the skin until fully absorbed. Use the eye cream morning and night as part of your skincare routine to maintain a youthful, refreshed appearance.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher as the final step in your morning skincare routine. Choose a lightweight, non-comedogenic sunscreen that provides comprehensive protection against both UVA and UVB rays without leaving a greasy or heavy residue. Apply a generous amount of sunscreen to your face, neck, and any exposed areas of skin, making sure to blend it evenly and allow it to dry completely before sun exposure. Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours, or as needed, especially if you'll be spending extended periods outdoors.</p>
