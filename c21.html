                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Gentle Cleanser:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Start your routine with a gentle cleanser that effectively removes impurities without stripping the skin of its natural oils. Look for a pH-balanced cleanser formulated for sensitive skin, free of harsh sulfates and fragrances. Massage the cleanser onto damp skin using gentle, circular motions, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. Cleanse your face twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin clean and balanced.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Balancing Toner:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Follow cleansing with a balancing toner to help hydrate and rebalance the skin's pH levels while minimizing excess oil and soothing any sensitivity. Choose a toner formulated with calming ingredients like witch hazel, chamomile, or green tea extract to help refine pores and reduce inflammation. Apply the toner to your face and neck using a cotton pad or by gently pressing it into the skin with clean hands. Use the toner morning and night to prepare your skin for subsequent skincare steps</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Hydrating Serum:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Incorporate a hydrating serum into your routine to replenish moisture and strengthen the skin's barrier function, helping to alleviate dryness and soothe any sensitivity. Look for a serum containing hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or glycerin to attract and retain moisture in the skin. Apply the serum evenly to your face and neck, focusing on dry or irritated areas, and allow it to absorb fully before proceeding to the next step.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Targeted Treatment:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Address specific skin concerns with a targeted treatment or serum tailored to your individual needs, whether it's anti-aging, acne-fighting, or soothing irritated skin. Choose a treatment containing active ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, or niacinamide to address your primary skincare concerns effectively. Apply the treatment to targeted areas or all over your face, depending on your needs, and allow it to absorb fully before applying moisturizer.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Moisturizer with SPF:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Finish your routine by applying a moisturizer with SPF during the day to protect your skin from sun damage and environmental aggressors while providing essential hydration. Look for a lightweight, non-comedogenic formula that contains broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher to shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays. Apply the moisturizer evenly to your face and neck every morning, reapplying throughout the day as needed, especially when outdoors or exposed to sunlight.</p>
