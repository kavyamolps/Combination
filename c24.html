                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Gentle Cleanser:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Start your skincare routine with a gentle cleanser that effectively removes excess oil, dirt, and impurities from the skin without causing dryness or irritation. Look for a foaming or gel-based cleanser formulated with mild surfactants and natural ingredients like tea tree oil or salicylic acid to help regulate oil production and clarify the skin. Massage the cleanser onto damp skin using circular motions, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. Cleanse your face twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin clean and refreshed.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Balancing Toner:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Follow cleansing with a balancing toner that helps refine pores, control oiliness, and restore the skin's natural pH balance. Choose an alcohol-free toner enriched with ingredients like witch hazel, niacinamide, or cucumber extract to help soothe and mattify oily areas while hydrating and refreshing the skin. Apply the toner to a cotton pad or your hands and gently pat it onto your face and neck, focusing on areas prone to excess oiliness. Allow the toner to absorb fully before proceeding to the next step in your routine.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Lightweight Moisturizer:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Hydrate and moisturize your skin with a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that provides hydration without clogging pores or leaving a greasy residue. Opt for a water-based or gel moisturizer formulated with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin to keep the skin soft, smooth, and shine-free throughout the day. Apply a small amount of moisturizer to your face and neck, gently massaging it into the skin using upward motions. Use the moisturizer twice daily, in the morning and evening, to maintain optimal hydration levels and balance oil production.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Mattifying Primer (Optional):</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">If you prefer to wear makeup, consider using a mattifying primer before applying foundation to help control oiliness and prolong the wear of your makeup. Choose a silicone-based primer with oil-absorbing properties to blur imperfections, minimize the appearance of pores, and create a smooth, matte finish. Apply a pea-sized amount of primer to your T-zone and other oily areas, blending it evenly onto the skin using clean fingertips or a makeup sponge. Allow the primer to set for a few minutes before applying foundation and other makeup products.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Oil-Absorbing Sheets:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Keep oiliness at bay throughout the day by carrying oil-absorbing sheets in your purse or bag for quick touch-ups on the go. These thin, portable sheets are designed to absorb excess oil and shine from the skin's surface without disturbing makeup or causing irritation. Gently press an oil-absorbing sheet onto oily areas of the face, such as the forehead, nose, and chin, and hold it in place for a few seconds to absorb the excess oil. Dispose of the sheet after each use, and enjoy a fresh, matte complexion anytime, anywhere.</p>
