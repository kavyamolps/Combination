                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Gentle Cleanser:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Start your skincare routine with a gentle cleanser that effectively removes impurities and excess oil without stripping the skin's natural moisture barrier. Opt for a non-comedogenic cleanser formulated with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to help unclog pores and prevent breakouts. Massage the cleanser onto damp skin using circular motions, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. Cleanse your face twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin clean and refreshed.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Exfoliating Treatment (2-3 Times a Week):</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Incorporate an exfoliating treatment into your routine 2-3 times a week to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and promote cell turnover, helping to prevent acne breakouts and improve skin texture. Choose a gentle chemical exfoliant containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), such as glycolic acid or salicylic acid, to help clarify the skin and reduce blemishes. Apply the exfoliant to clean, dry skin, avoiding the eye area, and leave it on for the recommended time before rinsing thoroughly with water.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Spot Treatment</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Target active breakouts with a spot treatment containing acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil to help reduce inflammation and promote healing. Apply a small amount of the spot treatment directly onto blemishes or areas prone to breakouts, using clean fingertips or a cotton swab. Allow the treatment to absorb fully before proceeding to the next step in your routine. Use the spot treatment as needed, applying it to individual blemishes or problem areas as they arise.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Lightweight Moisturizer</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Follow spot treatment with a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to hydrate and nourish the skin without clogging pores or exacerbating acne. Choose a moisturizer specifically formulated for acne-prone skin, containing hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or ceramides to maintain skin balance. Apply a small amount of moisturizer evenly to your face and neck, gently massaging it into the skin using upward motions. Use the moisturizer twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin soft and supple.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Finish your skincare routine by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher during the day to protect your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays, which can worsen acne and cause premature aging. Choose a lightweight, non-comedogenic sunscreen that won't clog pores or feel greasy on the skin. Apply sunscreen generously to your face and any exposed areas of skin, reapplying every 2 hours or as needed, especially when outdoors or exposed to sunlight.</p>
