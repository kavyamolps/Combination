                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Gentle Cleanser:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Start your routine with a gentle cleanser that effectively removes impurities and excess oil without stripping the skin's natural moisture barrier. Look for a non-abrasive cleanser formulated with soothing ingredients like chamomile, aloe vera, or green tea extract to calm the skin and minimize inflammation. Massage the cleanser onto damp skin using gentle circular motions, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. Cleanse your face twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin clean and refreshed without causing irritation or dryness.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Brightening Serum:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">After cleansing, apply a brightening serum that targets hyperpigmentation and promotes a more even skin tone. Choose a serum enriched with potent ingredients like vitamin C, niacinamide, or alpha arbutin to inhibit melanin production, reduce the appearance of dark spots, and enhance overall radiance. Apply a small amount of serum to clean, dry skin and gently massage it into the face and neck until fully absorbed. Use the serum every morning to maximize its brightening effects and protect the skin from environmental damage.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Exfoliating Treatment:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Incorporate an exfoliating treatment into your routine to help slough off dead skin cells and promote cell turnover, revealing fresher, brighter skin underneath. Opt for a gentle chemical exfoliant containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like glycolic acid or salicylic acid, which can effectively target hyperpigmentation and improve skin texture without causing irritation. Apply the exfoliant to clean, dry skin using gentle, sweeping motions, avoiding the delicate eye area. Start with a lower concentration and gradually increase frequency as tolerated to prevent over-exfoliation.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Brightening Moisturizer:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Hydrate and nourish your skin with a brightening moisturizer that addresses hyperpigmentation while providing essential moisture and hydration. Look for a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer infused with brightening ingredients like licorice extract, kojic acid, or bearberry extract to fade dark spots and promote a more uniform complexion. Apply a dime-sized amount of moisturizer to your face and neck, gently massaging it into the skin using upward motions. Use the moisturizer twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin soft, supple, and hydrated.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Sunscreen Protection:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Protect your skin from further pigmentation and sun damage by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher as the final step in your morning skincare routine. Choose a sunscreen specifically formulated for sensitive skin and prone to hyperpigmentation, with physical blockers like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which provide effective protection against both UVA and UVB rays without causing irritation. Apply a generous amount of sunscreen to your face, neck, and any exposed areas of skin, making sure to reapply every 2 hours, or as needed, especially if you'll be spending extended periods outdoors.</p>
