                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Gentle Cleanser:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Start your routine with a gentle cleanser that effectively removes impurities and excess oil without stripping the skin's natural moisture barrier. Look for a mild, fragrance-free cleanser formulated for sensitive skin to minimize irritation and inflammation. Massage the cleanser onto damp skin using gentle circular motions, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. Cleanse your face twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin clean and refreshed without causing dryness or sensitivity.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Hydrating Toner:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">After cleansing, apply a hydrating toner to replenish moisture and soothe the skin. Choose a alcohol-free toner with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or aloe vera to restore the skin's natural pH balance and prepare it for subsequent treatments. Pour a small amount of toner onto a cotton pad or into the palm of your hand, then gently pat or press it into your skin until fully absorbed. Use the toner twice daily, following cleansing, to keep your skin hydrated and calm.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Spot Treatment:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Address specific concerns like occasional breakouts or blemishes with a targeted spot treatment containing acne-fighting ingredients. Look for a spot treatment formulated with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or tea tree oil to reduce inflammation, unclog pores, and promote healing without drying out the skin. Apply a small amount of spot treatment directly to the affected areas using clean fingertips, then allow it to dry completely before proceeding with the rest of your routine. Use the spot treatment as needed, focusing on problem areas, to minimize breakouts and prevent future flare-ups.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Balancing Moisturizer:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Hydrate and balance your skin with a lightweight moisturizer that addresses specific concerns while providing essential hydration. Choose a non-comedogenic moisturizer formulated with soothing ingredients like chamomile extract, niacinamide, or ceramides to calm inflammation, balance oil production, and strengthen the skin's natural barrier. Apply a dime-sized amount of moisturizer to your face and neck, gently massaging it into the skin using upward motions. Use the moisturizer twice daily, in the morning and evening, to keep your skin hydrated and comfortable without clogging pores or causing shine.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(202, 133, 4);font-size: 16px;">Sunscreen Protection:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 2%;">Protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent further damage by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher as the final step in your morning skincare routine. Choose a sunscreen specifically formulated for sensitive or acne-prone skin, with lightweight, non-greasy texture that won't clog pores or cause breakouts. Apply a generous amount of sunscreen to your face, neck, and any exposed areas of skin, making sure to reapply every 2 hours, or as needed, especially if you'll be spending extended periods outdoors.</p>
